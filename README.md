My plan is to make flask web server that look like this: <br>

it will show real cryptocurrency data in random time. Your job is to buy in good moment and earn money. You can swipe time as fast as you want and wait for the moment to buy/sell/short but you can go back. For exsample you get data of monero 2016-06 - 2016-08 and you can swipe for next 6 months.
